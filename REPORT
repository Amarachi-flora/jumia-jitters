# JUMIA JITTERS â€“ Technical Report  
**Dataverse Africa July Challenge 2025**  
**By Amarachi Florence**

## INTRODUCTION  
The Dataverse Africa July Challenge aimed to address critical issues faced by **AfriMarket**, a fictional e-commerce platform, experiencing rising customer dissatisfaction due to complaints, fake reviews, slow deliveries, and unreliable sellers. As a Data Intelligence Officer, my mission was to analyze the marketplace data, identify fraudulent patterns, and recommend a seller trust framework to restore customer confidence in Nigeria and Ghana.

---

## DATASET OVERVIEW  
The analysis utilized a three-month log of marketplace activity, encompassing various attributes:

- **Order ID:** Unique transaction identifier  
- **Order Date, Dispatch Date, Delivery Date:** Timestamps for key order phases  
- **Seller ID:** Unique code for each seller  
- **Product Category:** Types of products sold (e.g., Electronics, Fashion)  
- **Price and Quantity:** Price per unit and quantity ordered  
- **Warehouse Zone:** Origin of shipment (e.g., Lagos, Accra)  
- **Customer Rating:** Rating scale from 1 to 5  
- **Review Text:** Optional customer feedback  
- **Sentiment Score:** Derived from review text  
- **Return Flag:** Indicator if the item was returned  
- **Complaint Code:** Type of complaint (e.g., Late Delivery)  
- **Delivery Method:** Options such as Express or Standard  
- **Customer Region:** Broad location of customers  

---

## METHODOLOGY  
The entire workflow covered:

### ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning  
- Standardized formats  
- Handled missing values  
- Flagged suspicious reviews by length and duplication  

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering  
- Delivery delay  
- Seller-level metrics: return rates, average ratings, complaint rates  
- Seller Risk Score combining all risk indicators  

### ðŸ”¹ Predictive Modeling  
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
- Tracked metrics like AUC, Precision, Recall  

### ðŸ”¹ Visual Analytics  
- Uncovered complaint/delay patterns using charts  
- Conducted ANOVA test for delivery method impact  

---

## TASK 1: DATA CLEANING & FEATURE ENGINEERING  

### Objective  
This task was all about preparing the data for deeper analysis. It included cleaning inconsistent entries, filling in blanks, and engineering new features like delivery delays and risk scores.

### Outcome  
The major highlight here was the creation of a **Seller Risk Score** â€” a single number that combines return rate, complaint rate, delay, and review issues.  

> From this step, AfriMarket can begin automatically scoring all sellers â€” helping to catch potential problems before they affect customers.

---

## TASK 2: PATTERN SURVEILLANCE  

### Objective  
This task explored patterns in the dataset using charts and statistics. I also tested whether delivery method impacts ratings.

### Key Insights  
- **Standard & Express** delivery methods dominate â†’ optimization focus  
- **Fashion & Electronics** triggered the most complaints â†’ audit priority  
- **Lagos & Greater Accra** drive high order volume â€” and delays  
- Fake review patterns detected using short text and duplication  

### Hypothesis Test  
ANOVA test results:  
**F-statistic = 0.87, P-value = 0.418**  
 Conclusion: Delivery method does **not** significantly affect customer ratings.

---

## TASK 3: PREDICTION & RISK MODELING  

### Objective  
Build a predictive model to flag products likely to be returned â€” helping the trust & safety team respond proactively.

### Model Used  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **AUC Score:** 0.8588  
- **SMOTE** handled class imbalance  

### Performance  
- **Precision:** 0.99 (No Return), 1.00 (Return)  
- **Recall:** 1.00 (No Return), 0.67 (Return)  
- **Confusion Matrix:** 294 TN, 4 TP  

### High-Risk Sellers Identified  
| Seller ID | Average Return Risk |
|-----------|---------------------|
| S014      | 0.90                |
| S041      | 0.89                |
| S018      | 0.86                |

These sellers had high return probability despite positive reviews â€” a sign of review fraud masking deeper issues.

---

## TASK 4: STRATEGY, DASHBOARD & RESOLUTION  

### Overview  
I built an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time seller profiling and filtering. The dashboard includes:

- Top 5 Risky Sellers to Suspend  
- Complaint Heatmaps  
- Region/Product filters  
- Fake Review Detectors  
- Seller Risk Framework breakdown  

###  Why Only 3 Sellers Showed Instead of 5  
Although the dashboard is labeled **"Top 5 Sellers to Suspend"**, only **3 sellers were shown**.  
Thatâ€™s because only three sellers in the cleaned and scored data actually met the **risk threshold** required to appear on the chart. Rather than force-fill the chart with lower-risk sellers, I kept it accurate â€” so what you see are **only the true high-risk cases**.

---

### Strategic Recommendations  

1. **Seller Suspension & Monitoring**  
   - Suspend top risky sellers like `S014`, `S041`, `S018`  
   - Track borderline sellers over time

2. **Blacklist High-Complaint Categories**  
   - Health, Electronics, Fashion, Toys, Groceries  
   - Run supplier audits in these categories  

3. **Delivery Delay Fixes**  
   - Reassign underperforming warehouses  
   - Enforce strict seller dispatch timelines  

4. **Customer Trust Policy**  
   - Transparent seller performance history  
   - 100% return guarantees  
   - 24/7 multilingual support  

5. **Review Fraud Detection**  
   - Flag duplicate and short 5-star reviews  
   - Use this as part of risk scoring going forward  

---

## BUSINESS CURVEBALLS HANDLED  

### 1. Lagos Delay Data Issue  
Some Lagos warehouse data was unreliable due to overcapacity.  
 Solution: Delivery delay from Lagos was **excluded** from average delay calculations.

### 2. Fake Review Pattern  
Some sellers had unusually short, duplicated 5-star reviews.  
 Solution: Reviews under 15 characters were flagged and incorporated into seller risk score.

- Seller/Product Risk Dashboard  
- Seller Risk Framework  
- Complaint Heatmap  
- Suspicious Reviews Chart  
- Top Risk Sellers  

---

## CONCLUSION  
This project provided hands-on exposure to solving real e-commerce issues: late deliveries, fake reviews, and risky sellers. Through data cleaning, predictive modeling, and visual analytics, I was able to surface key weaknesses and suggest data-backed strategies.

The **Seller Risk Score** turned out to be the game changer â€” unifying multiple risk factors into a single actionable metric.

---

## FUTURE WORK  
- Apply **transformer-based NLP** for smarter fraud detection  
- Build a live dashboard pipeline with **Streamlit Cloud**  
- Automate seller audits and feedback collection monthly
